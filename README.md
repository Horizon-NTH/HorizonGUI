## Introduction

**HorizonGUI** is a Graphic User Interface library made in C++ with OpenGL. There are also Python bindings available.

## Installation Instructions

* [C++ library](#c-library)
* [Python binding](#python-binding)

### C++ library

> You can also simply install a pre-built version [here](https://github.com/Horizon-NTH/HorizonGUI/releases).

#### Get Source Code

You first need to clone the repository. Make sure to use [git](https://git-scm.com) and don't forget to
include `--recurse-submodules` when cloning.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Horizon-NTH/HorizonGUI.git --recurse-submodules
```

You will now able to choose between [script](#script-installation) or [manual](#manual-installation) installation

#### Script Installation

Use the [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Horizon-NTH/HorizonGUI/blob/master/install.sh) script to compile the
library. You can also erase build files by adding `-e` / `--erase`.

  ```bash
  ./install.sh -e
  ```

#### Manual Installation

##### Create Build Environment

Ensure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed. Generate the build environment using CMake:

  ```bash
  cd HorizonGUI
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  ```

##### Build

###### CMake

Build directly using CMake:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

This command will create all the lib files you need in `HorizonGUI/lib`.

###### Microsoft Visual Studio

Alternatively, you can use [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to launch the project
and build it. Open the `horizongui.sln` file with Microsoft Visual Studio.

### Python binding

To install the Python bindings, you can execute the following command:

```bash
pip install ./python
```

Once the installation is complete, you can import the module into your Python script using the following statement:

```python
import hgui
```
